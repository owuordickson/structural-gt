BUILD & DISTRIBUTE PRE-COMPILED WHEEL
-------------------------------------

1. Install MinGW and ensure gcc is in your PATH.
    MacOS: brew install gcc
    Windows: download mingw-get-setup.exe installer

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies
    brew install igraph  # macOS (Homebrew)
    sudo apt install libigraph-dev  # Linux (Debian-based)

3. Compile the C extension {this will run without you having to (install in next the step), but with ModuleNotFoundError}
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace  # MacOS/Linux
    python setup.py build_ext --compiler=mingw32 --inplace  # Windows

4. Create a wheel (.whl)
    python -m build --OR-- python setup.py bdist_wheel
    pip install .

5. Install the wheel without needing compilation
    pip install dist/sgt-1.4.5-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
    or
    pip install sgt-1.4.5-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl

CREATING AN EXECUTABLE WITH PyInstaller
---------------------------------------

1. Install Pyinstaller with pip:
    pip install pyinstaller

2. Run PyInstaller once to create the .spec file:
     pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --icon=icon.ico src/StructuralGT.py    # creates StructuralGT.spec

3. Modify the first part of StructuralGT.spec (a) to look like versions in GitHub.

4. Run PyInstaller with .spec file. The executable is in dist/ folder:
    pyinstaller StructuralGT-Win.spec

5a. For Windows, use Inno Setup to create an installer. Share the setup.exe with users for installation and use.

5b. For MacOS, compress the StructuralGT.app file into a zip file. Share the zip file with users.
    Once downloaded by user, unzip the file and drag the app to the Applications folder.
    Users should 'Allow StructuralGT' under Privacy and Security.

6. For the terminal executable,
    Open a terminal application and execute the following command:
    StructuralGT-cli -f datasets/InVitroBioFilm.png -c datasets/sgt_configs.ini -t 1
