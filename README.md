# Structural Graph Theory Calculator

StructuralGT is designed as an easy-to-use Python-based application for applying graph theory (GT) analysis to structural networks of a wide variety of material systems. This application converts digital images of nano-/micro-/macro-scale structures into a graph theoretical (GT) representation of the structure in the image consisting of nodes and the edges that connect them. Fibers (or fiber-like structures) are taken to represent edges, and the location where a fiber branches, or 2 or more fibers intersect are taken to represent nodes. The program operates with a graphical user interface (GUI) so that selecting images and processing the graphs are intuitive and accessible to anyone, regardless of programming experience. Detection of networks from input images, the extraction of the graph object, and the subsequent GT analysis of the graph is handled entirely from the GUI, and a PDF file with the results of the analysis is saved.

* Works well with ```Python 3.8```
