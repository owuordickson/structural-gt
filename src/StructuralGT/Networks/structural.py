class _Compute:
    r"""Parent class for all compute classes in StructuralGT. Modelled after
    the :class:`_Compute` class used in **freud** :cite:`Ramasubramani2020`.

    The primary purpose of this class is to prevent access of uncomputed
    values. This is accomplished by maintaining a boolean flag to track whether
    the compute method in a class has been called and decorating class
    properties that rely on compute having been called.

    To use this class, one would write, for example,

    .. code-block:: python
        class Electronic(_Compute):

            def compute(...)
                ...
